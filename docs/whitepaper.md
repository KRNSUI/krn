## üéØ Executive Summary

KRN is a revolutionary decentralized platform built on the Sui blockchain that transforms the traditional complaint system into a transparent, incentivized, and community-driven ecosystem. The platform leverages blockchain technology to create an anonymous, censorship-resistant environment where users can voice grievances while earning rewards through the innovative "Stars" system.

**Key Innovation:** The KRN Stars system introduces dynamic pricing mechanics that create a self-balancing economy where engagement is rewarded and moderation is incentivized through escalating costs.

## üåü Project Vision

In the chaos of Web3's endless lines and broken promises, there rose a figure‚Äînot a woman but an archetype: the eternal complainer, the seeker of managers, the voice that would not be silenced. From that voice, $KRN was born: a token forged in the fires of grievance, sharpened by entitlement, and wrapped in the divine right to "speak to the blockchain's manager."

Yet within the satire lies power: for $KRN gathers every complaint, every demand, every eye roll, and alchemizes them into a living record of accountability. What began as a meme of impatience now stands as myth; the Karen ascended, her spirit immortalized in orange flame, forever calling out the broken and bending reality to her will.

## ‚≠ê Stars System: Revolutionary Engagement Mechanics

### Core Concept
The KRN Stars system is the world's first dynamic pricing engagement mechanism that creates a self-balancing economy through escalating costs and strategic incentives.

### Adding Stars (Favoriting)
| Star Position | Cost | Rationale |
|---------------|------|-----------|
| 1st Star | 1 KRN | Entry-level engagement |
| 2nd Star | 2 KRN | Moderate interest |
| 3rd Star | 3 KRN | High engagement |
| 4th Star | 4 KRN | Strong support |
| nth Star | n KRN | Linear scaling |

**Formula:** `Cost = Star Position`

### Removing Your Own Stars
| Star Position | Cost | Rationale |
|---------------|------|-----------|
| 1st Own Star | 2 KRN | Commitment penalty |
| 2nd Own Star | 4 KRN | Escalating commitment |
| 3rd Own Star | 6 KRN | High commitment cost |
| nth Own Star | 2n KRN | Exponential scaling |

**Formula:** `Cost = Star Position √ó 2`

### Removing Others' Stars (Moderation)
| Total Stars on Post | Cost | Rationale |
|---------------------|------|-----------|
| 1 Star | 2 KRN | Basic moderation |
| 2 Stars | 4 KRN | Moderate moderation |
| 3 Stars | 6 KRN | Advanced moderation |
| n Stars | 2n KRN | Expert moderation |

**Formula:** `Cost = Total Stars √ó 2`

### Economic Benefits
1. **Prevents Spam:** Escalating costs discourage low-quality engagement
2. **Rewards Commitment:** Users who maintain stars earn through others' removal costs
3. **Incentivizes Moderation:** High costs for removing others' stars prevent abuse
4. **Creates Scarcity:** Limited star positions per post increase value
